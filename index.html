	<h1>My name is Jalen Spruill</h1>
	  <p>I am a cyber security student. When I first heard we would be doing coding, I got a little nervous, but this turned out to be pretty fun. In my free time (which is pretty minimal) I enjoy reading, going to the movies, traveling, playing video games, cooking, baking and studying history. I did attempt to use the colormind site but my computer was able to register the color names. </p>
